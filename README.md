# Java Weather App üå§Ô∏è

A simple and clean desktop application developed in Java using the Swing library. It allows users to check the current weather for any city in the world by fetching real-time data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

This project was created as part of my personal portfolio to showcase skills in Java desktop development, consuming REST APIs, and handling JSON data.
